Create new Angular project:
    ng new <app-name> (This will also create a new dir <app-name>)
    ng new <app-name> --directory ./ (This is easier when you already have a git repo)

Builds and serves your application, rebuilding on file changes:
    ng serve
    ng serve --open
    The --open (or just -o) option automatically opens your browser to http://localhost:4200/
    ng serve --port 4201 if port 4200 is not available

Generates or modifies files based on a schematic:
    ng generate
    ng generate component <component-name>
    ng generate service <service-name>
    ng generate module <module-name> --flat --module=app
        --flat  Puts the file in src/app instead of its own directory.
        --module=app  Tells ng generate to register it in the imports array of the AppModule.

Runs unit tests on a given project:
    ng test

Builds and serves an Angular application, then runs end-to-end tests:
    ng e2e

Add a npm package
    ng add @angular/material
    ng add @angular/pwa

Compiles an Angular application into an output directory:
This is to build for Production
    ng build
Copy the contents of the dist/my-project-name folder to your web server for hosting the app.
